## Browser support

The entire project was written in Vanilla JavaScript with extension API supported by Chromium-based browsers. It should also work on Firefox, but it has not been tested yet.

The standalone `image-viewer.js` should work on all modern browsers, and you can integrated into your own website with own collect image script.

You may also use `image-viewer.js` with your own script with Tampermonkey or other alternatives.

## ToDo

1. `image-viewer.min.js`
2. support more image display mode

## History

The prototype of this project was created by Eky Kwan under the MIT License, and the author of the translations in `_locales` is unknown. The first release v0.1 was launched on 2012-07-05, and the last release v0.1.6 was on 2012-08-12. However, the license file was either lost or not included in the Chrome Web Store version.

Since I started using this extension, many new features have been added to the project. You can find the oldest version [here](https://github.com/hospotho/Image-Viewer-Legacy), some mirroring websites may still have the raw version of v0.1.6.

The old version was hard to extend, and I felt tired of it in June 2022. Therefore, I decided to clean up all the old-style, messy jQuery code and rewrite the project completely. The rewrite is now complete and has also been upgraded to manifest V3.

This project is currently developed and maintained by me.
